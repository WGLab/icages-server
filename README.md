iCAGES -- Integrated CAncer GEnome Score
==================

This is a Ruby on Rails application for running iCAGES online 

## What is iCAGES?

iCAGES (integrated CAncer GEnome Score) is an effective tool for prioritizing cancer driver genes for a patient. Given his/her genomic mutation information, iCAGES can accurately prioritize a list of candidate cancer driver genes.

## How does it work?

iCAGES is based on two layer design. The first layer takes somatic mutations as input and output a score for each mutation, evaluating its cancer driving potential. The second layer takes the output from the first layer as input and through a two-step ranking system, it outputs a list of prioritized genes that are predicted to be personalized cancer driver genes.

## Why should I choose iCAGES?

iCAGES is simple and effective. It has a very friendly user-interface, which is very easy for researchers, clinicians and other medical professionals to use. It demonstrates high performance in our current study. And ... it is fast.
