iCAGES -- Integrated CAncer GEnome Score
==================

This is a Ruby on Rails application for running iCAGES online.

## What is iCAGES?

iCAGES (integrated CAncer GEnome Score) is an effective tool for prioritizing cancer driver genes for a patient. Given his/her genomic mutation information, iCAGES can accurately prioritize a list of candidate cancer driver genes. For details, please see http://icages.usc.edu.

## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains Ruby on Rails application for running the iCAGES server. The actual backend program for iCAGES analysis is available at [here](http://www.github.com/WangGenomicsLab/icages/) as Perl code. The frontend is implemented with AngularJS.

## What is unique about iCAGES server?

iCAGES server is simple yet highly effective. It has a very user-friendly interface, which is very easy for researchers, clinicians and other medical professionals to use. Our analysis on personal cancer genomes demonstrated its good performance to identify personal driver genes. And ... it is fast.
