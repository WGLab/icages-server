iCAGES: start input file format checking and converting format if needed
iCAGES: start to run ANNOVAR index function to fetch radial SVM score for each mutation
iCAGES: start annotating each mutaiton using ANNOVAR
iCAGES: start loading Cancer Gene Census data
iCAGES: start loading KEGG Cancer Pathway gene data
iCAGES: start extracting Phenolyzer score for each gene

NOTICE: The --geneanno operation is set to ON by default
NOTICE: Reading gene annotation from /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/icages/db/hg19_refGene.txt ... Done with 48660 transcripts (including 10375 without coding sequence annotation) for 25588 unique genes
NOTICE: Finished gene-based annotation on 1479 genetic variants in /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-20.annovar (including 1479 with invalid format written to /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-20.annovar.invalid_input)
NOTICE: Output files were written to /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-20.annovar.variant_function, /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-20.annovar.exonic_variant_function
iCAGES: start extracting radial SVM score for each mutation from ANNOVAR OUTPUT
iCAGES: start parsing gene annotation files generated from ANNOVAR output
iCAGES: start multiplying radial SVM score from each mutation with Phenolyzer score
iCAGES: start filtering genes whose most deleterious mutation ranks above top 80 percent
iCAGES: start generating output
WARNING: not enough mutations for analysis, please make sure there are more than 1 non-synonymous mutations
WARNING: no genes is given iCAGES score
SUMMARY: your data contain  missense mutations harbored in 0 genes. Among these genes,  are predicted to be cancer driver genes,  belong to Cancer Gene Census and  belong to KEGG cancer gene pathway
iCAGES: finished at Fri Sep 19 00:38:22 2014
