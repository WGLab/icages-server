NOTICE: The --geneanno operation is set to ON by default
NOTICE: Reading gene annotation from /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/icages/db/hg19_refGene.txt ... Done with 48660 transcripts (including 10375 without coding sequence annotation) for 25588 unique genes
NOTICE: Reading FASTA sequences from /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/icages/db/hg19_refGeneMrna.fa ... Done with 53 sequences
WARNING: A total of 333 sequences will be ignored due to lack of correct ORF annotation
NOTICE: Finished gene-based annotation on 29 genetic variants in /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-22.annovar
NOTICE: Output files were written to /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-22.annovar.variant_function, /home/cocodong/www/iCAGES/public/temp/input-22.annovar.exonic_variant_function
iCAGES: start extracting radial SVM score for each mutation from ANNOVAR OUTPUT
iCAGES: start processing structural variations from ANNOVAR OUTPUT
iCAGES: start parsing gene annotation files generated from ANNOVAR output
iCAGES: WARNING! only missense mutations and potential loss-of-function structural variations are used in iCAGES. Your data contain 1 mutations that do not belong to either cateogory and they are not processed by iCAGES
iCAGES: start multiplying radial SVM score from each mutation with Phenolyzer score
iCAGES: start filtering genes whose most deleterious mutation ranks above top 80 percent
iCAGES: start getting list of drugs for predicted cancer driver genes
iCAGES: start generating output
SUMMARY: your data contain 28 missense mutations and  loss-of-function structural variations harbored in 26 genes. Among these genes, 6 are predicted to be cancer driver genes, 2 belong to Cancer Gene Census and  belong to KEGG cancer gene pathway
iCAGES: finished at Tue Oct 21 16:58:07 2014
